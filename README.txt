Simple SoC based on Xilinx picoblaze implemented in Verilog.
Project implemented in Xilinx ISE and contains the following modules implemented in Verilog:
    
    -> Xilinx Picoblaze available from Xilinx.
    -> Customized UART module.
    -> Memory Controller able to communicate with the external memory (M45W8MW16) on Nexys 3 board.
 
This project also contains a basic firmware in assembly.

This was my senior project presented in the University of SÃ£o Paulo as requirement to obtain the BS in Computer Engineering.
