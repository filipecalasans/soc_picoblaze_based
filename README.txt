Simple SoC based on Xilinx picoblaze implemented in Verilog.
Project implemented in Xilinx ISE and contains the following modules implemented in Verilog:
    
    -> Xilinx Picoblaze available from Xilinx.
    -> Customized UART module.
    -> Memory Controller able to communication with the external memory (M45W8MW16) on Nexys 3 board.
 
This project also contains a basic firmware in assembly.
